# Lickety-split HTML 5 apps with jQuery Mobile and Node.js


Building mobile web apps is surprisingly easy with [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/). Combine jQuery Mobile's simplicity with [Node's rapid development platform](http://nodejs.org/) and you have yourself a recipe for immediate satisfaction. 

In this hands-on workshop, I'll show you how to build a jQuery Mobile app using Node.js that works on a variety of mobile devices. We'll go over the pros and cons of jQuery Mobile and [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) in general and I'll present alternative options. You'll leave this workshop armed with the knowledge of how to leverage what's arguably the most popular mobile web app framework today, HTML5, and the web to build single code base apps that run across a wide variety of devices. 


## Let's get started! 

This workshop is organized into 3 labs. We don't have a lot of time, so I strongly suggest you pair with someone. People with OSX, please volunteer to be pairing partners as it'll reduce friction because I'm also on OSX. That is, if you have Windows or Linux and someone near you is on a MacBook, then you should probably ask to pair with that person as my directions are tailored to OSX. 

### Clone or download this repository

To work on the 6 labs for this workshop, you'll need to either clone ([using Git](http://git-scm.com/)) this repository or you can [download a zip file of the source](https://github.com/aglover/lickety-split-HTML-5-apps/archive/master.zip). Either way, you will need the lab files on your local machine! 

### Pro tip

We're going to be looking at source code. You'll want to use a developer friendly editor like [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) or [TextMate](http://macromates.com/). You are free to use an IDE too -- it's entirely up to you. 

#### Lab #1

In Lab #1, you'll find an `index.html` file.  If you double-click it or open it with a modern browser (i.e _not_ IE) you should see a prototypical jQuery Mobile web app.
